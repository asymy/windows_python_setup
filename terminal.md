# Navigating the terminal

- Dont be scared
- google is your friend
- dont run bash scripts you downloaded from internet without understanding what it is doing first
- eventually you will be much faster in terminal than in gui

## config file

- located in home directory, usually called `.bashrc` or `.bash_config`
- hidden file, so cannot be directly seen in windows explorer/finder
- play around with settings until you find a prompt, shortcuts, theme etc that suits you

## windows terminal

- basically the only good option i have found for windows

## macos

- iterm2 is king

## linux

- many flavours but usually the default is good
